                    <p>Hello People! My favorite greeting to you all in Nepali language "Namaste". I'm so much happy to be a part of University of Richmond BootCamp. I never thought, I would one day persue career in web development. In fact, I found it as one of the very rewarding career. I'm happy that I choose to be a part of it. I can't imagine six months from now. I believe,  I'm a nerd and little techy too!. I believe in myself that I'm capable of doing anything. I'm a person who is always looking for new innovative ways to solve problems. I love to work in an environment where challanges are tackled every single time. I would feel accompalished when I can prove by solving such tasks on given deadline. I enjoy learning new things and implimenting it into my practical life.</p>
                    <p>The picture captured above is one of my proudest moments of my life as I was recogonized and awarded for my work. I was recogonized and awarded as "Refugee Mental Health Advocate of the year 2017". This is one of the awards that show my ability and dedication towards my work. For this proud moment, I thank those all who considered me and provided letter of recommendation to Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, a State Agency. </p>
